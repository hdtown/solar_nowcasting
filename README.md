## Overview/Synopsis ##

In order to predict Solar Power with a lead time of 30 min, a network
of pairs of hemispheric sky-cameras are installed in the vicinity of
Solar PV installations. Images are collected every 30s. Then corrected
for orientation and geometric distortion. Triangulation of cloud edges
as seen from the two cameras in each pair gives cloud heights limited
to two distinct cloud layers. Tracking of cloud edges in successive
images gives wind speed and direction in those two cloud layers and
from that the ability to predict what areas will be shaded in the near
term future.
